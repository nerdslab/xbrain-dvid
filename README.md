# xbrain 

This repository contains methods for _analyzing and quantifying neuroanatomy in X-ray microtomography images_. You can find further details about how we apply the methods in this repo to analyze mm-scale brain volumes in the following paper:

__Dyer, Eva L., et al. "Quantifying mesoscale neuroanatomy using X-ray microtomography." arXiv preprint, [arXiv:1604.03629](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03629) (2016).__

If you use any of the code or datasets in this repo, please cite this paper.
