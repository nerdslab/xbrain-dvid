This repository contains methods for _analyzing and quantifying neuroanatomy in X-ray microtomography images_. You can find further details about how we apply the methods in this repo to analyze mm-scale brain volumes in the following paper:

__Dyer, Eva L., et al. "Quantifying mesoscale neuroanatomy using X-ray microtomography." eNeuro, [eneuro.org/content/4/5/ENEURO.0195-17.2017](http://www.eneuro.org/content/4/5/ENEURO.0195-17.2017) (2017).__
